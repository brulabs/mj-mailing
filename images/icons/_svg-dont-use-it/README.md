## SVG graphics in emails

Many mail programs can also handle SVG. But especially Outlook - once again - does not. And also Gmail doesn't display SVG or only partially, not even in the web version.

Even with some tricks you can read about on the internet, a satisfying coverage can be realized. Therefore, unfortunately, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that it is better not to use SVG at the moment.
